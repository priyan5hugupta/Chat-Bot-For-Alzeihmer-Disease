# Chat-Bot-For-Alzeihmer-Disease
This project develops an advanced chatbot system for Alzheimer's disease prediction, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze brain MRI images. The chatbot incorporates image-based predictions for early detection, as well as natural language processing (NLP) to engage with users through text-based interaction. Additional features include Wikipedia integration for contextual information and sound-based interaction via speech recognition, offering cognitive assessments through auditory inputs. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, providing an accessible platform for uploading images, conversing with the chatbot, and receiving diagnostic feedback. This multi-modal system combines image, text, and sound for a comprehensive Alzheimerâ€™s prediction and support tool.
